As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.

Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\\n\\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\\n\\n  arguments:\\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run.
