Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Key Files:\n- Based on the GitHub link, the change needs to be in `/testbed/pylint/__init__.py`, line 99\n- We should verify the exact location in our local repo\n\n3. Reproduction Steps:\n- Need to create a test script that mimics the runpy scenario\n- Will insert a custom path and verify it gets removed incorrectly\n\n4. Implementation Approach:\n- The fix should wrap the sys.path.pop(0) in a condition\n- Need to import `os` module for getcwd() check\n- Should handle all 3 cases: \"\", \".\", and cwd\n\nLet me first check the __init__.py file to confirm the exact line that needs changing.\n\n",

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Finally, I'll verify the fix by running the reproduction script again\n\nLet's start by creating the reproduction script and testing",

Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\n`pylint` removes first item from `sys.path` when running from `runpy`.\n### Bug description\n\nThis is the line where the first item from sys.path is removed.\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/ce7cccf96454fb6e286e4a8f38919733a0f28f44/pylint/__init__.py#L99\r\n\r\nI think there should be a check to ensure that the first item is `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing.\n\n### Configuration\n\n_No response_\n\n### Command used\n\n```shell\nRun programmatically to repro this, using this code:\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\nimport runpy\r\n\r\nsys.path.insert(0, \"something\")\r\n\r\nrunpy.run_module('pylint', run_name=\"__main__\", alter_sys=True)\n```\n\n\n### Pylint output\n\n```shell\nWhen using pylint extension which bundles the libraries, the extension add them to sys.path depending on user settings. Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."
