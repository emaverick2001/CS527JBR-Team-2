Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

If that attribute is a non-empty string, it uses that parent value and returns [sys.executable, '-m', parent, ...sys.argv[1:]].\n  - If __spec__ is not set (None) or parent is empty (''), the function falls back to the previous behavior (comparing sys.argv[0] to django.__main__.__file__ and the Windows exe/script fallbacks).\n\nWhy\n- The PR description specifies that get_child_arguments should detect -m <pkg> invocations by checking __main__.__spec__.parent. This is the documented mechanism and works for packages other than django (for example: python -m pkg_other_than_django).\n- This approach avoids relying on __file__ being present on modules (which isn't guaranteed in all Python environments).\n\nFiles modified\n- django/utils/autoreload.py (only get_child_arguments implementation changed)\n\nRepro script and run\nI added a small repro script at /testbed/repro.py to simulate being launched as python -m pkg_other_than_django by setting __main__.__spec__.parent to 'pkg_other_than_django'. I ran it and got the expected args.\n\nCommands I ran and their output:\n\n1) Show the modified function area (snippet):\n- (I inspected the file to ensure changes were applied.)\n\n2) Repro script content (saved to /testbed/repro.py):\n- The script simulates __main__.__spec__.parent = 'pkg_other_than_django' then prints get_child_arguments().\n\n3) Run repro:\n$ python /testbed/repro.py\n\nOutput:\nsys.argv: ['/testbed/repro.py']\n__main__ in sys.modules: True\nget_child_arguments -> ['/opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python', '-m', 'pkg_other_than_django']\n\nThis shows get_child_arguments now returns the correct command-line to restart the process with -m pkg_other_than_django when __main__.__spec__.parent is set accordingly.\n\nNotes and edge-cases handled\n- If __main__.__spec__ is None (older environments or certain debuggers), the function falls back to the previous heuristic (compare sys.argv[0] to django.__main__.__file__ to detect python -m django, handle Windows exe and -script.py entrypoints).\n- If __main__.__spec__.parent is an empty string (this happens in some documented cases like running a directory or zipfile), it will not be considered as a -m <pkg> invocation because empty string is falsey; the fallback detection will be used.\n- The Windows-specific fallbacks (executing .exe directly or -script.py entrypoint) are unchanged.\n- The implementation does not attempt to normalize or validate parent beyond using its truthiness; this mirrors the logic required by the PR (parent == \"pkg\" indicates -m pkg).\n\nIf you'd like, I can:\n- Run the test suite (if pytest and test dependencies are available) to ensure all tests pass.\n- Adjust the detection to be more defensive (e.g., ensure parent is a str before using it).\n- Add comments or a short unit test demonstrating behavior for the -m detection (though you mentioned test files are already handled).",

Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

If __spec__ exists and parent is a non-empty string, that indicates Python was invoked as python -m <parent>. In that case build the child args as [sys.executable, '-m', parent, *sys.argv[1:]] and return them.\n- Fallback behavior:\n  - If __main__.__spec__ is not present (older/odd environments), fall back to the prior heuristics (compare sys.argv[0] with django.__main__.__file__, handle exe entrypoints and -script.py entrypoints, otherwise return sys.executable + sys.argv).\n\nWhy this fixes the issue\n- The __main__.__spec__.parent method is the documented way to detect a -m invocation and avoids relying on __file__ being set on modules. It allows autoreload to support autoreloading when a user runs python -m <some_package> where the package is not django (the change in the PR description), which was the failing scenario.\n\nWhat I ran locally while working\n- I created a short reproduction script to simulate sys.modules['__main__'] having __spec__.parent set and confirmed get_child_arguments returns the expected argument list (e.g. includes '-m' and the package name).\n- I committed the code change.\n\nNotes and edge-cases handled\n- If __main__.__spec__.parent is the empty string (which can happen when Python runs a __main__.py from a directory or zipfile path), we treat that as \"not a -m <package>\" because the parent is empty (we check truthiness), and fall back to original heuristics.\n- If __spec__ is not set at all (older runtimes or certain interactive/debugger contexts), the previous comparison to django.__main__.__file__ and Windows fallbacks are still used.\n- If __spec__.parent is something like 'pkg.subpkg' (multi-component parent), using '-m parent' is correct.\n\nDeveloper notes / how to run tests locally\n- To run the test suite locally, use pytest (this environment doesn't have pytest available):\n  - pip install -r requirements (or ensure Django/testing deps are available)\n  - pytest -q\n- The relevant tests are in tests/utils_tests/test_autoreload.py (TestChildArguments and RestartWithReloaderTests cover the behavior we changed).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Run the repository test suite here (if pytest/requirements are installed in the environment).\n- Adjust the implementation to handle any additional special cases you want covered.",

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \\\"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\\\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \\\"pkg\\\".\\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\\n\",\"extra_fields\":{},\"type\":\"text\",\"id\":\"django__django-13837\"},\"output_dir\":\"DEFAULT\",\"actions\":{\"open_pr\":false,\"pr_config\":{\"skip_if_commits_reference_issue\":true},\"apply_patch_locally\":false},\"env_var_path\":null}",
